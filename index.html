	    Planning
    </h1>
    Cuneyt plans its action quite simplisticly, for movement, it just goes on a linear path until it senses an obstacle and tries to go around it. If it sees a person it knows, it executes specific commands. (Face recognition WIP)

	<h1>
		Action
	</h1>
	Cuneyt moves in any direction with its mechanum wheels, there's a simple trigonometric equation behind it. <br>
	It can also nod with its camera!
